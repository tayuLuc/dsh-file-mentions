[![Awesome DSH Plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/badge.svg)](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com)

**Clickable file paths in DSH replies** — a DeepSeek Harness (DSH) web plugin with a Codex-style experience.

*Unofficial project: independently developed and maintained by a community member, not an official DeepSeek product.*

## Screenshot

![dsh-file-mentions in action](assets/screenshot.png)

Inline paths wrapped in backticks (`` `~/...` ``, absolute, relative, or Chinese paths) become
**click-to-open**; each clickable path carries a small folder-icon button that reveals the file in your
file manager; a "📎 mentioned files" chip list at the turn tail covers the rest. URLs are
already auto-linked by the official renderer, so this plugin leaves them alone.

**Line references (fork).** A reference written the way notes are cited — `note.md:12`,
`/abs/path/file.ts:7-20` — opens the file and jumps to the line. The core renderer already
understands the fragment spelling (`note.md#L12`) but passes the colon spelling straight to the
filesystem, where the suffix becomes ENOENT; this fork strips it before the read and hands the
line to the editor. A Windows drive letter (`C:\x.md:12`) and an authority colon
(`http://host:8080/a.md`) are left intact.

![External-drive whitelist settings](assets/screenshot-settings.png)

The external-drive whitelist (Settings → Plugins → file-mentions): **local files in your home
directory are clickable by default**; only external drives / network volumes (e.g.
`/Volumes/USB`) need their root added here — one path per line. System-disk marker
directories (`/System`, `/etc`) are rejected automatically.

## Features

| Where | What | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Inline path text | click | Open with default app / open directory |
| folder icon after inline path | click | Reveal in file manager |
| "📎 mentioned files" chip | click name | Preview content inside DSH |
| folder icon in the chip list | click | Reveal in file manager |
| Inline URL | click | Browser opens it (official autolink) |

Supports `~/` expansion, relative paths (resolved against the session cwd), and absolute
paths in macOS / Linux / Windows forms. Non-existent paths silently do nothing.

## Division of labour with the official features (since 2026-10-01)

DSH 0.2 already ships several ways to open files. This plugin **only fills the gaps the official build leaves** instead of duplicating them:

| Scenario | Owner |
|---|---|
| `@` completion for files/folders/sessions in the composer | **official** (`dsh-file-reference` + `ui-reference`) |
| Markdown file links in messages (`[x](path)`, with `#L24`) | **official** (opens in the right sidebar) — this plugin **skips anything inside `<a>`**, so nothing is decorated twice |
| The session-header "Open In…" button and the sidebar preview's "open with default app / show in folder" | **official** (`dsh-host-open-in-app`) |
| **Bare paths in backticks** in message text (`` `~/x/y.md` ``, which the official renderer ignores) | **this plugin**: click to open with the system default app |
| The folder icon next to a bare path (reveal in file manager) and the "📎 mentioned files" rail at the end of a reply | **this plugin** (no official counterpart) |

## Install

This repository is an official **bundle plugin** (`dsh.bundle` + `dsh.client` in the root
`package.json`), installed through the official profile manager:

```sh
# DSH 0.1.7 and later:
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions#main"
# DSH 0.1.5 and older (this release needs 0.1.7+):
# dsh plugin --profile web add "github:a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions#v1.0.14"
```

Then **restart `dsh web`** (bundle layers are composed at startup; HMR does not apply).
Requires `pnpm` on PATH (`dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm).

Manual mount fallback: see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Usage

Have the agent wrap paths in backticks (e.g. `` `~/docs/plan.md` ``) to make them clickable
inline. The tail chip list appears automatically — no configuration.

### Paths outside the session directory (external drives, etc.)

Local files inside your **home directory** (e.g. `~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`) are clickable by
default — no configuration needed. For paths on an **external drive / network volume** (e.g.
`/Volumes/USB`), add that root to the **external-drive whitelist** in Settings → Plugins →
file-mentions (one path per line). Saving takes effect immediately — no restart required.

System-disk protection: whitelist roots containing system marker directories (`/System`,
`/etc`, or `\Windows` on Windows) are rejected automatically, so a full system disk mounted
externally can never be whitelisted by mistake.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | ✅ Fully tested (incl. Chinese paths) |
| Linux | ⚠️ Not tested — expected to work (command branching and path parsing implemented) |
| Windows | ⚠️ Not tested — expected to work (command branching and path parsing implemented) |

## Requirements

- DSH web >= 0.1.0-rc.6 (run with `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web`)
- **Version compatibility** (best effort — the settings card uses dual-field `key`+`id` registration to satisfy both rc.6 (`id`) and rc.7+ (`key`); verified locally on rc.6/rc.8/0.1.1-rc.2/0.1.2-alpha.2/0.1.5-rc.1 (clickable paths + "mentioned files" panel), **not guaranteed on every DSH version**):
  - DSH 0.1.0-rc.6 and newer (incl. 0.1.1-rc.1/rc.2 and 0.1.2): try `main` (default).
  - **DSH 0.1.5-rc.1: load-verified** (the plugin is in the client bundle and `/api/file-mentions/check` responds); UI interactions were not eyeballed item by item. ⚠️ 0.1.5 ships a **narrow** built-in "clickable inline-code paths in the closing reply" (only files written via `write`/`edit`/`present` in that turn — see `dsh-client-ui-deliverables`), which partially overlaps; plain-text/bare paths, cross-turn and historical messages are still handled only by this plugin.
  - Conservative fallbacks (the last pre-0.1.1 build): DSH 0.1.0-rc.7/rc.8 → `v1.0.8` (`dsh plugin add github:a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions#v1.0.8`); DSH 0.1.0-rc.6 → frozen `rc6-compat` tag (no maintenance).
- Pure Node stdlib implementation — peer dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings`,
  `@deepseek-ai/schemastery`) are provided by the host
- Opening files uses the system default app / file manager (per-platform command branching)
  - ✅ **DSH 0.1.7 and later — use this release (`v1.2.2`)**: it declares `peerDependencies: {"@deepseek-ai/dsh": "^0.1.7-rc.1 || ^0.2.0-rc.1"}`, so a mismatched host refuses to load it with an explicit reason instead of failing quietly. Settings move to the 0.1.7 model (plugin `Config`, live-editable `.volatile()` fields), so changes apply without a restart.
  - ✅ **DSH 0.2.0-rc.1 — verified compatible**: the peer range now covers both lines (`^0.1.7-rc.1 || ^0.2.0-rc.1`) and `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` adds `"0.2.0-rc.1": "compatible"` — verified on a real 0.2.0-rc.1 host and a shadow instance. Since 0.2 the host gates profile bundles on peer compatibility and **skips the whole bundle** when the declared range misses the running host, so this range is what keeps the plugin loading.
  - ⚠️ **DSH 0.1.5 and older — install the previous tag `v1.0.14`**: that line keeps the old behavior and uses no 0.1.7-only API.
  - ⛔ **Old plugin releases (up to `v1.0.14`) are not supported on 0.1.7** — the external-disk whitelist silently becomes empty (`settings.get` is gone). Upgrade the plugin together with the host.
- **Maintenance policy**: this plugin keeps evolving with the latest DSH releases; compatibility with older DSH versions is best-effort only and not guaranteed going forward.

## How it works

- **Host** (`lib/index.js`): three routes — `/api/file-mentions/check` (existence check),
  `/api/file-mentions/open` (system open, `mode: open/reveal`, per-platform command) and
  `/api/file-mentions/config` (whitelist read/write for the settings page). All three routes
  are same-origin guarded. Probe surface: absolute/`~/` paths are checked only inside the session cwd or
  user-declared whitelist roots (stored via the official settings service — immediate
  effect, no restart); whitelist roots are protected against system disks and symlink
  escapes. Pure Node stdlib; `execFile` avoids shell injection.
- **Client** (`lib/client.js`): a conversationEvents collector extracts paths from each
  reply → publishes them to turn data → the tail list filters non-existent paths before
  rendering; inline clicks use a **document-level click delegation** (the official render
  entry is occupied by the official "deliverables" plugin, so DOM delegation is the only
  viable path); inline folder-icon buttons are inserted by a MutationObserver and restored
  automatically after React re-renders; a settings card (sidebar section + plugin page)
  edits the whitelist. Scanning/decoration is **incremental**: the observer callback only
  handles newly-added nodes inside the official message area (`[data-conversation-scroll]`),
  each new text is cheap-screened for path-like characters (no `/`, `~` or `\` → skipped
  with zero regex work and zero requests), and existence checks hit only the current
  session — conversations without paths trigger no scanning at all; sidebars, hover cards,
  menus and settings are never touched (v1.0.13).

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Notes

- Use either the official bundle install or the manual mount — never both.
- Manual mounting needs a **single entry** in `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml`; a double entry
  applies the plugin twice and crashes on duplicate route registration.

## Compatibility notes

- Inline clicks rely on backtick-wrapped paths (the agent-output convention, same as
  Codex); **bare paths inside message text are clickable too** (decoration is
  CSS-Highlight only, zero DOM mutation; message area only — sidebars, hover cards,
  menus and settings are never touched, v1.0.13).
- The official "produced files" list and this plugin coexist: official wins when it has
  output, otherwise this plugin shows.
- Windows / Linux validation via issue or PR is welcome.
